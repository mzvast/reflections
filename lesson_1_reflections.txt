How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I think if the former program works fine,and the later one crash,then there
    must be some bugs in the changed lines.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    use git version control system.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros:I can choose when to save and review them easily if I need.
    cons:Sometimes may forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Depend on its file's user scale.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    use git log to view the commit history,and git diff to compare two files with their ids.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Yes,now it makes me dare to modify files without fear,because I can go back to anywhere.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
